## HWInfo-Log-Viewer Introduction

[简体中文](README_CN.md)

HWInfo-Log-Viewer is a cross-platform application built with `Tauri` and `Vue3`. It provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing CSV log files generated by HWiNFO, allowing users to easily browse and analyze sensor data.

## i18n (UI only)

- You can switch the UI language in **Settings → Preferences → Language**.
- Sensor/group names shown in the sidebar come from the CSV/header/backend grouping data, and are **not translated by the UI i18n layer**.

Sample CSV:

- English sample: `src-tauri/data/1_EN.CSV`
